Is he the author? Did he find a script and changed it? No idea.

However.
The normal script dumps out all the files, resulting in a fully extracted .bin.
But we don't need that. We need boot images. So I just changed a line to do that and also made an executable + GUI to extract boot images.

Have fun.

If you are the original author, let me know, I'll add your name, repo, everything here.
I did try to search Github but could not find the source to fork it.
